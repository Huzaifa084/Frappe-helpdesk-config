Setting Up Your Frappe Helpdesk on Another PC
To set up your Frappe Helpdesk project on another PC, you'll need to transfer the configuration files and follow these steps:

Prerequisites for the New PC
Install Docker Desktop
Install Docker Compose
Make sure ports 8000 and 9000 are available
Step-by-Step Transfer Process
1. Transfer the Project Files
Transfer these essential files to the new PC:

docker-compose.yml
init.sh
You can copy them using a USB drive, cloud storage, or by creating a Git repository.

2. Create the Project Directory

# Create a directory for the project on the new PC
mkdir "c:\Users\path\to\HelpDesk"

3. Place the Files
Copy the transferred files into this directory:

docker-compose.yml
init.sh

4. Start the Project
Navigate to the project directory and start the containers:

cd "c:\Users\path\to\HelpDesk"
docker-compose up -d

5. Monitor the Installation Process
The first start will take time as it downloads Docker images and sets up the environment:

docker-compose logs -f frappe

6. Wait for Initialization to Complete
This process will:

Download the Frappe Docker image
Initialize the Frappe bench
Set up the database
Install the Helpdesk application
Build all required assets
7. Access the Application
Once initialization is complete (usually takes 10-20 minutes), access your application at:

http://localhost:8000
Log in with:

Username: Administrator
Password: admin
Troubleshooting on the New PC
If Assets Are Missing

docker-compose exec frappe bash -c "cd /home/frappe/frappe-bench && bench build --app helpdesk"

If You Get Redis Connection Errors
Check if the Redis URLs in the docker-compose.yml file have the correct format:

REDIS_CACHE=redis://redis:6379
REDIS_QUEUE=redis://redis:6379
REDIS_SOCKETIO=redis://redis:6379

If the Application Is Not Starting
Ensure there are no port conflicts:

netstat -ano | findstr :8000
netstat -ano | findstr :9000
